This repository contains code for the synthetic pancreas circuit models written in the Julia programming language. The circuit contains a glucose resposive switch that expresses RFP or GFP based on glucose levels in the blood sample. 

This code was generated using the JuGRN code generator in Julia from the Varner GitHub Repository. Julia v1.4 must be installed to run this code. In addition, the following packages are required: DifferentialEquations.jl, DiffEqSensitivity.jl, NumericalIntegration.jl, DelimitedFiles.jl, JSON.jl, DataFrames.jl, LinearAlgebra.jl, PyPlot.jl
